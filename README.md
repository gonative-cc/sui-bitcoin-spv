## Overview

This repository contains a set of primitive components for on-chain Bitcoin operations:

- [Bitcoin SPV](./packages/bitcoin_spv) - A core implementation of a Bitcoin light client using Simple Payment Verification (SPV). It manages the on-chain storage of the Bitcoin block header chain, validates new headers, and provides functions to verify transaction inclusion using Merkle proofs.

- [Bitcoin Parser](./packages/bitcoin_parser) - A low-level, foundational utility for parsing and deserializing raw Bitcoin data structures. It handles block headers, transactions, inputs, outputs, and witness data, providing the essential building blocks for the applications.
